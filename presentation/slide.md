## Mini test
### 冒頭に紹介した海外の経営者に含まれない人は次のうちどれ
- マーク・ザッカーバーグ
- ビル・ゲイツ
- イーロン・マスク
- ジェフ・ベゾス
- ラリー・ペイジ



## 1. Set a goal
Note: First story is how I set a goal.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://kenjasyukatsu.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/imasia_15432350_S.jpg" -->
- Joined internship<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Became fun of IT industry<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Apply IT companies<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note: Let's go back to my history of job hunting season when I was an university student. I went to smoe 1day internships in Japanese traditiona company. And...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- Every interviewer asked me...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "Could you tell me about your programming experience?"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: In the interview, Every interviewer asked me ""


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "I learned in programming class!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- ...＼(^o^)／<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: I answered "I learned Java in the class. and yeah, that's all so far." And of course I couldn't pass as a result...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
I need experience.
Note: When I look around there are many students who might have a great experience, and looks smart. So I realized I'm not on the start line yet. So I decided to quit job hunting activity, and decided to find more practical internship.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/givery_start.jpg" -->
### Start internship in Givery
- 5 employees<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- No job offer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: Only 5 employees, small office, but I was really excited because I can do everything. I felt it might be higher risk that I don't have any practical experience before guraduation.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/givery_start.jpg" -->
- I started up a recruiting business "For Engineer"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- for people like me<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: I believe that there are some people who have a same issues as me.


### First
I held matching event in University of Tsukuba.
- Target was 100 students<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Result...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- 20...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- includes staff!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->


### But I was okay!!


## What I want to do is
to get experience of making something from scruch by myself<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


That passion makes me motivative


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/g2g.jpg" -->
Keep organizing event


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/tw.jpg" -->
Go San Francisco


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/fb.jpg" -->
Go San Francisco


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/freepaper.jpg" -->
To publish freepaper


### 1 year later from the first event


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/swa2.jpg" -->
### 1 year later from the first event
- 300 students
- 30 companies


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/swa.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
And it was introduced by TV news.


We don't need a clear goal from first.


Don't think deeply, do something.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://lifecareerup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CBEVrnZUkAAzZjB.jpg" -->
## How to set a goal
- Set a "simple" goal whatever you want<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- There is no "correct" answer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Done is better than perfect<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: do something fast.



## 2. Achieve a goal
Note: Second story is how I achieve a goal.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://tech-camp.in/note/wp-content/uploads/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88-2016-08-10-16.52.56.png" -->
There will be 600,000 short in Japan<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


I started up more "Educational" business


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1d/4d/c4/1d4dc4836eee6bc731646c1c921a2d1e.png" data-background-size="contain"-->
### CODEPREP
Online programming service


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/dmtc1.jpg" -->
### Hackathon style event
create a product, compete with teams in 2days.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/dmtc2.jpg" -->
I felt we will be able to succeed


But...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/fb.jpg" -->
Quit CTO...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/flaming.png" -->
- Event was Flamed...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Lost sponsor <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Close event<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: And we lost sponsor, need to quit the event at the end...


### I realized
"I" always thought something for "me"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


### I couldn't do something for
- our team
- clients


- No one exists for me.
- No one want a service for me.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- No one want to work for me.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


I reconsidered **why we do?**


"Empowering Engineers"
Note: I decided to change my mind,


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://2015.jphacks.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/tokyo.jpg" -->
Note: Fortunatelly, one attendance of our event introduced a professor who want to hold a hackathon event in University of Tokyo.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://2015.jphacks.com/wp-content/themes/jphacks_2015/images/gallery/gallery-1.png" -->
## Finally
#### Our Event (JPHACKS)
- Co-hold with National Universities
- 300 students
- 6 venues


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/techcrunch.png" -->
## Finally
#### CODEPREP
- 50,000 Users


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://images.fastcompany.com/upload/paul-graham-process-375.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
- Most successful startups are overnight success. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- That night is usually somewhere between<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> **day 1000 and day 3500**.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://images.fastcompany.com/upload/paul-graham-process-375.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
We have taken "2370 days"


So we are in still a long way to go...


In Apple,Inc case


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="assets/videos/steave.mp4" data-background-size="contain" -->


**"Think different"**
- Apple is not just a hardware maker
- They believe that people who have a passion can change the world for the better.


You will surely face a limit and big wall if you want to do something only for "yourself".


## If you want to achieve a big goal
- Think what CORE VALUE is<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Think for someone<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Never give up<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: So if you want to achieve a big goal, keep thinking and thinking



## 3. Go forward with a team
Note: The last story is how I go with a team.


I was in trouble with team.<br>
We had no developers after CTO left.
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team5.png" -->
Note: I really


- A UI/UX designer applied to our job posting.
- But He is Canadian.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- I had no choice but to have an interview with him.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: Of course I can't speak in Enligh, he knew our company from his room mate of share house who joined our hackathon event before.


## First question
- He asked
- "I can't speak Japanese.Is it okay"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- "Ah, Yes!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- (I can't speak English though...)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: We can't


## Second question
- The designer asked me
- "Hey, can we hire developer internship with paying for general salary? They are smart!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- "Ah, Yes!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- (Why do we have to pay for internship as much as general employee...)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: The designer introduced me that


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team6.jpg" -->
But our member increased little by little


### Since then...
- Hey, can I work remotely?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Hey, I want go back canada for 2 weeks for Xmas and new year vacation!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Hey, can I go to gym around noon? I can work until midnight at the day instead!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

- I always say<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- YES!!!YES!!!YES!!!YES!!!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->


But...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team4.png" -->
The number of team member surely increased.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team3.png" -->
### Before I knew it...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Just saying "yes" makes our team<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- looks international<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- diverse<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- good culture for work emvironment<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team2.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
### And then...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- We could hire experienced developer.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- He said, "I can give you my experience, but I can learn English, and culture."<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/04/09/6359581182881760131419052954_Yes-Man.jpg" -->


## I said otherwise
- Our passion, vision
- Objects, why we do
- Issues that we should solve


- They can consider good solution instad of me.
- It is impossible for me to come up with those idea.


## Finally it leads to
- our creativity  
- various of ability
- make a good decision


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/team1.jpg" -->
## How to go forward with a team
- Say "YES!!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Trust your team<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Don't say "how", but "why" we do!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## conclusion


## How to set a goal
- Set a "simple" goal whatever you want
- There is no "correct" answer
- Done is better than perfect


## How to achieve a big goal
- Think what CORE VALUE is
- Think for someone
- Never give up


## How to go forward with a team
- Say "YES!!!"
- Trust your team
- Don't say "how", but "why" we do!

## Ending
Note:
My grand father has gone when I


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
# A strong will <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings advance<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note:
If it says in English


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
# To be honest<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings you successful<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
A strong will brings advance, <br>To be honest brings you successful.
Note:
I understood it means that "a strong will" is not enough for the successful.
So you need to be honest if you want to success. We need both.
keep thinking someone except you in your life.
And do whatever you can do for someone all the time.
By doing that, someone will surely help you when you face any troubles and crisies.


## Thank you for listening!!
### And any questions?
