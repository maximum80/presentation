<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://d3fhkv6xpescls.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Leadership-chalkboard.jpg" -->
I have experience!
Note:
But I experienced a lot includes failue.  


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://d3fhkv6xpescls.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Leadership-chalkboard.jpg" -->
### Leadership is
- To set a goal<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- To achieve a goal<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- To go forward with a team<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note:ここまで25分
Through my experience, I'm understanding what leadership is to ...
So this is just throwing my two cents,  
Today, I'm gonna talk to you how I tried to lead our team with my 3 stories.



## 1. Set a goal
Note: 20分程度
First story is how I set a goal.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://kenjasyukatsu.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/imasia_15432350_S.jpg" -->
- Joined internship<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Became fun of IT industry<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Apply IT companies<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note: Let's go back to my history of job hunting season when I was an university student. I went to smoe 1day internships in Japanese traditional company. But it was too board for me, but on the other hand, internship of IT company was really fun because they all like new things, don't have to wear annoying suite lol. I became to like IT industry culutre, and decided to apply focus on IT company.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- Every interviewer asked me...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "Could you tell me about your programming experience?"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: But in the interview, Every interviewer asked me ""


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "I learned in programming class!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- ...＼(^o^)／<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: I answered "I learned Java in the class. and yeah, that's all so far." And of course I couldn't pass as a result...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
I need experience.
Note: When I look around, there are many students who might have a great experience, and looks smart. So I realized I'm not on the start line yet. So I decided to quit job hunting activity, and decided to find more practical internship.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/givery_start.jpg" -->
### Start internship in Givery
- 5 employees<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- No job offer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: I was lucky I found Givery that hire internship, and allow me to build new business. So I dived into there. It was only 5 employees, small office, but I was really excited for me because I can do everything what I wanna try. I felt it might be higher risk that I don't have any practical experience before guraduation.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/givery_start.jpg" -->
- I started up a recruiting business "For engineer students"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- for people like me<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: I regretted that I should have understand the value of programming, and learned programming more. So I believe that there are some people who have a same issues as me.


### First
I held matching event in University of Tsukuba.
- Target was 100 students<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Result...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- 20...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- includes staff!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
Note: to let them know how exisitng IT industry is, and help them to find IT startups earlier. But I failed.


### But I was okay!!


## What I want to do is
to get experience of making something from scruch by myself<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note: Because What I wannna do is,


That passion makes me motivative


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/g2g.jpg" -->
Keep organizing event


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/tw.jpg" -->
Go San Francisco


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/fb.jpg" -->
Go San Francisco


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/freepaper.jpg" -->
To publish freepaper


### 1 year later from the first event
Note: Just keep doing such a thing, as a result


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/swa2.jpg" -->
### 1 year later from the first event
- 300 students
- 30 companies


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/swa.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
And it was introduced by TV news.


We don't need a clear goal from first.


Don't think deeply, but just do it.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://lifecareerup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CBEVrnZUkAAzZjB.jpg" -->
## How to set a goal
- Set a "simple" goal whatever you want<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- There is no "correct" answer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Done is better than perfect<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: Do something fast if you come up with idea. Leave your desk, just go out for the real world.



## Mini test


### 冒頭に紹介した海外の経営者に含まれない人は次のうちどれ

## 2. Achieve a goal
Note: 40分程度
Second story is how I achieve a goal.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://tech-camp.in/note/wp-content/uploads/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88-2016-08-10-16.52.56.png" -->
There will be 600,000 short in Japan<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


I started up more "Educational" business


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1d/4d/c4/1d4dc4836eee6bc731646c1c921a2d1e.png" data-background-size="contain"-->
### CODEPREP
Online programming service


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/dmtc1.jpg" -->
### Hackathon style event
create a product, compete with teams in 2days.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/dmtc2.jpg" -->
I felt we will be able to succeed


But...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/flaming.png" -->
- Event was Flamed...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Lost sponsor <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Close event<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: the negative article written by one attendance buzzed around developers communitiy, And we lost sponsor avoid dis-branding, So we need to quit the event at the end...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/fb.jpg" -->
Left CTO...
Note: He started to work in competitor...


### I considered why...


"I" always thought something for "me"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


### I couldn't do something for
- our team
- clients


### I realized
- No one exists for me.
- No one want a service for me.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- No one want to work for me.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


I re-condidered


**why we do?**


"Empowering Engineers"
Note: I decided to change my mind, set this concept.
We believe that people who have "passion" and "technology" can change the world for the better.
Note: We want to provide an opportunity for those people to learn technology, to find their career plan through those activity.And we believe that Empowering engineers would lead to develop Japanese economy.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://2015.jphacks.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/tokyo.jpg" -->
Note: Fortunatelly, one attendance of our event introduced a professor univ of tokyo who want to hold a hackathon event in University of Tokyo.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://2015.jphacks.com/wp-content/themes/jphacks_2015/images/gallery/gallery-1.png" -->
## Finally
#### Our Event (JPHACKS)
- Co-hold with National Universities
- 300 students
- 6 venues
Note: We could make a brand new with University of Tokyo.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/techcrunch.png" -->
## Finally
#### CODEPREP
- 50,000 Users


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://images.fastcompany.com/upload/paul-graham-process-375.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
- Most successful startups are overnight success. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- That night is usually somewhere between<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> **day 1,000 and day 3,500**.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: Just for tips, this is a famous word explaning starups. サーティーファイブハンドレッド


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://images.fastcompany.com/upload/paul-graham-process-375.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
We have taken "2370 days"


So we are in still a long way to go...


In Apple,Inc case
Note: Let me introduce my favorite video that Steave jobs propose their new brand concept when he came back to Apple.


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="assets/videos/steave.mp4" data-background-size="contain" -->


**"Think different"**
- Apple is not just a hardware maker
- They believe that people who have a passion can change the world for the better.
Note: Apple was bad situation before he came back, but he changed Apple with this new concept.


You will surely face a limit and big wall if you want to do something only for "yourself".
Note: I think


## If you want to achieve a big goal
- Think what CORE VALUE is<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Think for someone<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Never give up<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: So if you want to achieve a big goal, keep thinking and thinking



## 3. Go forward with a team
Note: 60分程度
The last story is how I go with a team.


I was in trouble with team.<br>
We had no developers after CTO left.
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team5.png" -->
Note: I really


- A UI/UX designer applied to our job posting.
- But He is Canadian.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- I had no choice but to have an interview with him.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: Oneday, A UI/UX designer applied. Of course I couldn't speak Enligh well, he told that knew our company from his room mate of share house who joined our hackathon event before.


## First question
- He asked
- "I can't speak Japanese. Is it okay"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- "Ah, Yes!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- (I can't speak English though...)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: When interview, he asked me...
Finally we decided to hire him.


## Second question
- The designer asked me
- "Hey, can we hire student developer internship with paying for general salary? They are smart!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- "Ah, Yes!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- (Why do we have to pay for student internship as much as general employee...)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: The designer introduced me that


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team6.jpg" -->
But our member increased little by little


### Since then...
- Hey, can I work remotely?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Hey, I want go back canada for 2 weeks for Xmas and new year vacation!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Hey, can I go to gym around noon? I can work until midnight at the day instead!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

- I always say<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- YES!!!YES!!!YES!!!YES!!!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->


But...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team4.png" -->
The number of team member surely increased.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team3.png" -->
### Before I knew it...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Just saying "yes" makes our team<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- looks international<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- diverse<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- good culture for work emvironment<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/team2.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
### And then...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- We could hire experienced developer.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- He said, "I can give you my experience, but I can learn English, and culture."<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/04/09/6359581182881760131419052954_Yes-Man.jpg" -->


## I said "Yes" and otherwise
- Our passion, vision
- Objects, why we do
- Issues that we should solve


- They can consider good solution instad of me.
- It is impossible for me to come up with those idea.


## Finally it leads to build
- creativity  
- variety
- make a good decision
Note: which I couldn't come up with


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/team1.jpg" -->
## How to go forward with a team
- Say "YES!!!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Trust your team<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Don't say "how", but "why" we do!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: So, if you want to go forward with team,



## conclusion
Note: 75分程度


## How to set a goal

## How to achieve a big goal
- Think what CORE VALUE is

## Ending
Note: 80分程度<br>
(Let me talk about my grandfather.) My grandfather has gone when I just started to work.
So I tried to find something for keepsake in my granpa house.
and I found this


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
# A strong will <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings advance<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note:
I found this calligraphy sheet over 10 or more written by him.
He seemed write this phrase again and again.
I felt that perhaps it might be his most valuable phrase.
If it says in English


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
# To be honest<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings you successful<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
A strong will brings advance, <br>To be honest brings you successful.
Note:
I understood it means that "a strong will" is not enough for the successful.
So you need to be honest if you want to success. We need both.
keep thinking someone except you in your life.
And do whatever you can do for someone all the time.
By doing that, someone will surely help you when you face any troubles and crisies.


## Thank you for listening!!
### And any questions?
