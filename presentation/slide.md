Note:
Through my experience, I'm understanding what leadership is to ...
So this is just throwing my two cents,  
Today, I'm gonna talk to you how I tried to lead our team with my 3 stories.



## 1. Set a goal
Note: First story is how I set a goal.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://kenjasyukatsu.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/imasia_15432350_S.jpg" -->
- Joined internship<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Noticed the fun of IT industry<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Apply IT companies<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note: Let's go back to my job hunting season when I was an university student. I went to smoe 1day internships in Japanese traditiona company. And...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- Every interviewer asked me...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "Could you tell me about your programming experience?"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
Note: In the interview, Every interviewer asked me ""


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
- I answered...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "I learned in programming class!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- ...＼(^o^)／<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
Note: I answered "I learned Java in the class. and yeah, that's all so far." And of course I couldn't pass as a result...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53527f27e4b07854cfc3c1bf/t/5898276429687ff9f4d2aa71/1486366577166/eikaiwanow" -->
Note: When I look around there are many students who might have a great experience, and looks smart. So I realized I'm not on the start line yet. So I decided to quit job hunting activity, and decided to find more practical internship.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/images/givery_start.jpg" -->
### Start internship in Givery
- Around 5 employees
- No job offer
Note: But I felt it might be higher risk that I don't have any practical experience before guraduation.

# A strong will <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings advance<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note:
If it says in English


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
# To be honest<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
# brings you successful<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background="assets/images/granpa.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"-->
A strong will brings advance, <br>To be honest brings you successful.
Note:
I understood it means that "a strong will" is not enough for the successful.
So you need to be honest if you want to success. We need both.
keep thinking someone except you in your life.
And do whatever you can do for someone all the time.
By doing that, someone will surely help you when you face any troubles and crisies.


## Thank you for listening!!
